# CODING LOG
## 2017

- 19.12.2017
  - I need to deal with my daily job tasks most of the day again.
  - There is a meeting in the deparment about surveying. But at least I've created this log.
  - I create [sum-all-numbers-in-a-range.js](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/sum-all-numbers-in-a-range.js)
  - and I update the links in the README.md of Algorithms-problem-solving repository.

  - I couldn't code today. Because of my daily job tasks.
